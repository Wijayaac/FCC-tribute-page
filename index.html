                    <p>
                        Norman Ernest Borlaug (/ˈbɔːrlɔːɡ/; March 25, 1914 – September 12, 2009) was an American
                        agronomist who led initiatives worldwide that contributed to the extensive increases in
                        agricultural production termed the Green Revolution. Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his
                        work, including the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional
                        Gold Medal.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Borlaug received his B.S. in forestry in 1937 and Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics from the
                        University of Minnesota in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position with CIMMYT in
                        Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-yield, disease-resistant wheat varieties.
                        During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties
                        combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, Pakistan, and India. As a
                        result, Mexico became a net exporter of wheat by 1963. Between 1965 and 1970, wheat yields
                        nearly doubled in Pakistan and India, greatly improving the food security in those nations.

                    <p>
                        From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a microbiologist at DuPont in Wilmington, Delaware.
                        It was planned that he would lead research on industrial and agricultural bacteriocides,
                        fungicides, and preservatives. However, following the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor
                        Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor regulations; his
                        lab was converted to conduct research for the United States armed forces. One of his first
                        projects was to develop glue that could withstand the warm salt water of the South Pacific. The
                        Imperial Japanese Navy had gained control of the island of Guadalcanal, and patrolled the sky
                        and sea by day. The only way for U.S. forces to supply the troops stranded on the island was to
                        approach at night by speedboat, and jettison boxes of canned food and other supplies into the
                        surf to wash ashore. The problem was that the glue holding these containers together
                        disintegrated in saltwater. Within weeks, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed an adhesive
                        that resisted corrosion, allowing food and supplies to reach the stranded Marines. Other tasks
                        included work with camouflage; canteen disinfectants; DDT to control malaria; and insulation for
                        small electronics.[17]

                        <br><br>
                        In 1940, the Avila Camacho administration took office in Mexico. The administration's primary
                        goal for Mexican agriculture was augmenting the nation's industrialization and economic growth.
                        U.S. Vice President-Elect Henry Wallace, who was instrumental in persuading the Rockefeller
                        Foundation to work with the Mexican government in agricultural development, saw Avila Camacho's
                        ambitions as beneficial to U.S. economic and military interests.[19] The Rockefeller Foundation
                        contacted E.C. Stakman and two other leading agronomists. They developed a proposal for a new
                        organization, the Office of Special Studies, as part of the Mexican Government, but directed by
                        the Rockefeller Foundation. It was to be staffed with both Mexican and US scientists, focusing
                        on soil development, maize and wheat production, and plant pathology.

                        <br><br>

                        Stakman chose Dr. Jacob George "Dutch" Harrar as project leader. Harrar immediately set out to
                        hire Borlaug as head of the newly established Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program
                        in Mexico; Borlaug declined, choosing to finish his war service at DuPont.[20] In July 1944,
                        after rejecting DuPont's offer to double his salary, and temporarily leaving behind his pregnant
                        wife and 14-month-old daughter, he flew to Mexico City to head the new program as a geneticist
                        and plant pathologist.[17]
                        <br><br>
                        In 1964, he was made the director of the International Wheat Improvement Program at El Batán,
                        Texcoco, on the eastern fringes of Mexico City, as part of the newly established Consultative
                        Group on International Agricultural Research's International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center
                        (Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo, or CIMMYT). Funding for this autonomous
                        international research training institute developed from the Cooperative Wheat Research
                        Production Program was undertaken jointly by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the
                        Mexican government.
                        <br><br>
                        Besides his work in genetic resistance against crop loss, he felt that pesticides including DDT
                        had more benefits than drawbacks for humanity and advocated publicly for their continued use. He
                        continued to support pesticide use despite the severe public criticism he received for
                        it.[21][22] Borlaug mostly admired the work and personality of Rachel Carson but lamented her
                        Silent Spring, what he saw as its inaccurate portrayal of the effects of DDT, and that it became
                        her best known work.[23]
                        <br><br>
                        Borlaug retired officially from the position in 1979, but remained a CIMMYT senior consultant.
                        In addition to taking up charitable and educational roles, he continued to be involved in plant
                        research at CIMMYT with wheat, triticale, barley, maize, and high-altitude sorghum.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1981, Borlaug became a founding member of the World Cultural Council.[24]
                        <br><br>
                        In 1984, Borlaug began teaching and conducting research at Texas A&M University. Eventually he
                        was given the title Distinguished Professor of International Agriculture at the university and
                        the holder of the Eugene Butler Endowed Chair in Agricultural Biotechnology.
                        <br><br>
                        He advocated for agricultural biotechnology as he had for pesticides in earlier decades:
                        Publicly, knowledgeably, and always despite heavy criticism.[25][22]
                        <br><br>
                        Borlaug remained at A&M until his death in September 2009.

                        In 1968, Borlaug received what he considered an especially satisfying tribute when the people of
                        Ciudad Obregón, where some of his earliest experiments were undertaken, named a street after
                        him.
                        Also in that year, he became a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.
